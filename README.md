# Next.js Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`].

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

git clone https://github.com/SwarnaShikhar/blog.git
cd blog
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Features

### Tailwind CSS

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for designing. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development.

### shadcn/ui

For a UI component library, we have integrated [shadcn/ui](https://shadcn.dev/). This library provides a set of high-quality, customizable components that work seamlessly with Tailwind CSS.

### Dark Mode

Dark mode has been implemented using the [`next-themes`](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes) library. This allows users to toggle between light and dark themes, enhancing the user experience in different lighting conditions.

### Mobile Responsive

The application is fully mobile responsive, ensuring a smooth and consistent experience across all device sizes.

### Reusable Components

We have created reusable components for the blog and post cards. This promotes code reusability and makes the application easier to maintain and extend.

### Dynamic Content

All the content inside the blog and post sections comes from the `blogData.json` and `postData.json` files. This makes it easy to manage and update content without modifying the code.

### Google Fonts

We have used Google Fonts to enhance the typography of the application, providing a clean and professional look.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
